Maximilian Held is a PhD fellow at the Bremen International Graduate School of Social Sciences. He works on the link between (progressive) taxation and (deliberative) democracy.

He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Integrated Social Sciences from Jacobs University Bremen and has studied Demography and Social Sciences (graduate) at the University of California, Irvine. He also studied Public Policy at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin.

Max is a Fulbright fellow, a scholar of the German National Academic Foundation and the Hertie Foundation and a 2008/2009 fellow at the Berlin Studies Centre, a European excellence program.

After completing his PhD, Max wants to work in politics, activism or research. 

Aside from his passion for policy and politics, Max is a (failed) IT-entrepreneur, sporadic violinist and (karaoke) singer, sometimes-excited blogger, Science Slammer and fervent disciple of Deutsche SchülerAkademie, a summer school program for gifted high school students.
