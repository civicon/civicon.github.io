Maximilian Held is a PhD fellow at the [Bremen International Graduate School of Social Sciences (BIGSSS)](http://www.bigsss-bremen.de/). 
He works on the link between (progressive) taxation and (deliberative) democracy.

He holds a Bachelor of Arts in [Integrated Social Sciences](http://www.jacobs-university.de/iss/) from [Jacobs University Bremen](http://www.jacobs-university.de/) and has studied [Demography](http://www.demography.uci.edu/ma_program.html) and Social Science (graduate) at the [University of California, Irvine](http://www.uci.edu/). 
He also studied [Public Policy](http://www.hertie-school.org/home.php?nav_id=1980) at the [Hertie School of Governance](http://www.hertie-school.org/) in Berlin.

Max is a [Fulbright](http://fulbright.state.gov/) fellow, a scholar of the [German National Academic Foundation](http://www.studienstiftung.de/start.html?&L=1) and the [Hertie Foundation](http://www.ghst.de/en/index.php) and a 2008/2009 fellow at the [Berlin Studies Centre](http://www.studienkolleg-zu-berlin.de/?q=node/421), a European excellence program.

After completing his PhD, Max wants to work in politics, activism or research. 

Aside from his passion for policy and politics, Max is a (failed) [IT-entrepreneur](http://www.collaboran.de/), sporadic violinist and (karaoke) singer, sometimes-excited [blogger](http://www.maxheld.de/), [Science Slam](http://www.scienceslam.de/)mer, wannabe [hacker](http://github.com/maxheld83/) and fervent disciple of [Deutsche Sch√ºlerAkademie](http://www.deutsche-schuelerakademie.de/index.htm), a summer school program for gifted high school students.
