I enjoy teaching tremendously -- and for selfish reasons, too:
I've noticed that I only *really* understood a subject (or someone else's understanding of it) if I have taught a class on it.


I like it:

- *Interdisciplinary*.
Crossing disciplinary borders and venturing applications can deepen understanding, strengthen relevance and forge synthesis -- but a rigorous foundation in *a* discipline always comes first.
- *Interactive*.
Meaningful visualizations, vibrant virtual and real discussion and the occassional movie segment can make teaching more effective, accessible and fun -- but in technology and format, as elsewhere, form follows function.
That said, I think some great new technology (such as [Github](http://www.github.com) and [Google+](http://plus.google.com)) isn't used enough in classrooms, and I expect my students to be(come) reasonably savvy with it.
- *In writing*.
An idea does not exist independent of its written expression.
Intensive reading and writing are hard, ideally [deliberate practice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice) for both teacher and student -- but for the social sciences, at least, there are only very poor substitutes.
