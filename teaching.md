I enjoy teaching tremendously -- and for selfish reasons, too: 
I've noticed that I only *really* understood a subject (or someone else's understanding of it) if I have taught a class on it.


I like it:

- *Interdisciplinary*.
Crossing disciplinary borders and venturing applications can deepen understanding, strengthen relevance and forge synthesis -- but a rigorous foundation in *a* discipline always comes first.
- *Interactive*.
Meaningful visualizations, vibrant virtual and real discussion and the occassional movie segment can make teaching more effective, accessible and fun -- but in technology and format, as elsewhere, form follows function.
That said, I think some great new technology (such as [Github](http://www.github.com) and [Google+](http://plus.google.com)) isn't used enough in classrooms, and I expect my students to be(come) reasonably savvy with it.
- *In writing*.
An idea does not exist independent of its written expression.
Intensive reading and writing are hard, ideally [deliberate practice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice) for both teacher and student -- but for the social sciences, at least, there are only very poor substitutes.

Here's a list of classes I've taught:


## Schools of Democracy -- Deliberative Democracy & Inclusive Pedagogy (2014)

- seminar
- in German
- taught together with [Verena Kasztantowicz](http://www.erziehungswissenschaften.hu-berlin.de/grundschulpaed/mitarbeiterinnen/lb-deutsch)
- at [Talent & Education](http://www.bildung-und-begabung.de/) / [Deutsche SchülerAkademie](https://www.deutsche-schuelerakademie.de/), a summer school for gifted students.)

The class introduces students to a defining conflict of both pedagogy and political theory:
the contradiction and mutual contigency of equality, difference and autonomy in living together as political and social beings.
The comparison of both disciplines reveals striking parrallels that can be applied to current experiments with inclusive pedagogy and deliberative democracy.

## Progressive Taxation & Deliberative Democracy (2014)

(at the [Department of Political Science](http://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/professuren/ipw/startseite/), [Universität Hamburg](http://www.uni-hamburg.de/))

Taxation and democracy can be thought of as two sides of the liberal-democratic, capitalist social contract: 
Democracy concerns the making of collectively binding decisions, and taxation is the chief means to implement these agreed-upon plans within the market exchanges of free agents. 
Taxation thereby delineates the boundary of private property and collective responsibility, but it also shapes the material conditions under which citizens exercise their political autonomy. 
Taxation and democracy, along with their mutual dependencies and contradictions, in short, are deeply implicated in social scientific questions of rule and power, social integration and inequality.

As institutions, they are also the (only?) site, where progress might happen. This seminar looks at two such reform proposals, equally radical and pragmatic: 
progressive taxation and deliberative democracy.

## German Politics & Culture (2010-2014ff)

(at the [School of Humanities and Social Sciences](http://shss.jacobs-university.de/shss), [Jacobs University Bremen](http://www.jacobs-university.de/))

"German Politics and Culture" has a dual objective, as both area studies and applied social science theory seminar.

On the one hand, the class is an "area study" of German history, politics and culture. 
It charters the various German Sonderwege (unique, separate historic path) and Irrwege (meanders) from the failure of the Weimar Republic to fascist rule and the institutionalization of liberal democracy in the Federal Republic to current challenges facing the welfare state and the crisis of european integration. 
Germany is interesting in its own right, as a leading economy and European pioneer, but also serves as a powerful prism of the dynamics, disruptions and contradictions of western (post?-)modernity. 
In addition, of course, it is the home to Jacobs University and its international students.

On the other hand, the class applies selected theoretical perspectives from the breadth of social sciences and beyond to contextualize the German experience, ranging from Political Science and Sociology to Social Psychology and Economics. 
The course highlights primary texts by renowned authors --including Hannah Arendt, Zygmunt Bauman, Charles Tilly, Philip Zimbardo, Robert Dahl, Peggy & Richard Musgrave, Claus Offe and Jürgen Habermas -- whose diverse and seminal contributions serve both to train students in their application as well as to elucidate what is specific to the German experience, and what can be generalized.

## The Grass, its Green, and the Other Side -- Comparative Analyses of Democracy, Welfare, Media, Administration, Political Culture and Economy (in Planning) 
 
 "The most dangerous outlook on the world is the outlook of those people, who have not looked at the world." 
 -- Alexander von Humboldt
 
Liberal democracy, market economies and their institutional correlates, it turns out, come in different varieties. 
Even within the OECD-world of rich, developed nation states, democratic rule (Lijphart), welfare states (Esping-Andersen), media landscapes (Hallin & Mancini), administration (Hood), political culture (Inglehart & Welzel) and economic systems (Hall & Soskice) vary widely. 
Using both empirical data (a posteriori) and deductive reasoning (a priori), positive comparative research in political science and beyond has distilled these differences into patterns, that often track deep ideological divides (e.g. liberal vs. conservative) and roughly map geography (e.g. continental vs. anglo-american). 
This seminar surveys some of the recently prominent comparative work ("the other side", figuratively speaking), provides a preliminary understanding of the nature and genesis of the institutions ("the grass") under investigation, and ultimately subjects these varieties to a selective normative critique (concerning their "greenness").
As we will see, the differences across these institutions complement and contradict one another, both within and between their constituent systems, and together, explain much of the difficulty of economic and political integration.  
These differences also reveal seemingly intractable trade-offs between goals that are often cited in conjunction, as, for example, between majority rule and broad participation or between general training and niche market leaders.
Beneath these trade-offs may lurk some of the inevitable choices in modern institutional design, but also, perhaps, some common challenges or idiosyncratic diversity, and with it, the limits of comparative analyses.
