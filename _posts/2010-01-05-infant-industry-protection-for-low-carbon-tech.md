How to react to global warming? 
How do wean ourselves off that harmful oil – and still prosper?

I [maintained](http://maxheld.wordpress.com/2009/12/10/the-copenhagen-game/) that we’d [better be safe](http://maxheld.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/for-alarmism/) with Sinn‘s fears of a [Green Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_paradox) than sorry without him, notwithstanding the uncertainties of his argument.

Economist Hans-Werner Sinn is no easy read for a green German: 
he pretty much pulls german and European green policy into pieces. 
Much of his critique is plausible, if unsettling: 
without international cooperation, much of our unilateral efforts may be in vain.

But there’s one thing where I wholeheartedly disagree with Sinn: 
low-carbon technology, for the time being, does indeed require subsidies.

Yes, it may be hard for states to pick winners, but low-carbon technology still needs infant industry incubation, if it is to sustain us in the near future.


## Low-Carbon Technology: A Case for Internalizing Costs?

One simple (simplistic, I think) way to think about the development of low-carbon technology is to think in terms of internalizing the environmental costs of high-carbon technology. 
Given the right present and expected price of carbon emissions, necessary investments into new technology in renewable energy and efficiency enhancements would then be undertaken by individually rational market participants.

Sinn seems to believe that this is the best way to approach green innovation: 
to internalize the externality of man-made global warming and leave the rest to the market.


## Low-Carbon Technology: Market Failure Under Limited Foresight

While circularly true of course, given his assumptions of a perfect market with infinite foresight and rationality, I find such uncritical trust in the market mechanism to implausible, and dangerous.

Given the experience we have with financial markets, it seems doubtful that these actors will indeed find it individually rational to inject the colossal amounts of capital required for the development of a new, greener future. 
A boundedly rational fund manager with limited foresight is unlikely to see the potential in a technology that won’t become competitive for decades, until finally, fossil fuel scarcity and drastic reductions in emissions make it feasible.

Decisions requiring such extended foresight are sometimes best made, or aided, by a central planner.


## Low-Carbon Technology: Market Failure from Public Good Innovations

Similarly, fundamental innovations on the scale needed to make us carbon-neutral are frequently, and often for good reasons, public goods: 
the benefits of its invention (think: MP3 audio compression) do not exclusively accrue to its inventor, but to many copycats, too. 
Because the rewards of these highly improbable, but game-changing improvements are distributed widely, investors are unlikely to shoulder its highly concentrated risks of failure.

Research and development for such fundamental innovations, as all other public goods, requires the provision by a central planner.


## Low-Carbon Technology: A Case for Intertemporal Infant Industry Incubation

A related argument is that of [infant industry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_economics#Infant_industries) protection. 
To become competitive, innovations in renewables and efficiency enhancement may well first have to be prototyped, improved and scaled up in protected corners of the market before they can prove their superiority on world markets.

Industries and technologies that require [economies of scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale) and [learning curves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve) frequently require initial protection or subsidizing by a central planner, before they can successfully compete. 
Some (but not all!) experiences of [import-substituting industrialization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import_substitution_industrialization) as well as the phenomenal technological progress of wind power in Germany seems to support this view of things.


## Low-Carbon Technology: Still, Picking Winners Ain't Easy

A lesson that Hertie‘s guest lecturer in political economy, [Dr. Stormy-Annika Mildner](http://www.swp-berlin.org/en/forscher/forscherprofil.php?id=6148) has instilled in me is that, just as markets, states can fail, too when it comes to the efficient allocation of scarce resources.

The history of infant industry protection certainly provides ample support for that lesson: 
frequently, states failed to pick the would-be winners and didn’t phase out protection and subsidies when they were no longer needed. The hype around a now-demystified [hydrogen economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_economy) and car and the windfalls (pun intended) gained by some renewables producers are cases in point.

Still, these shortcomings and dangers of state-intervention and infant industry incubation should not lead us to throw out the baby with the bathwater.

Sinn provides some valuable criticism of the current subsidizing of renewable energy in Germany. 
He argues that policies are overly complex (think: multiple sources of subsidies, plus guaranteed feed-in tariffs), feature discretionary exemptions and are not adequately integrated into the [EU Emissions Trading System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Emission_Trading_Scheme).

Good state-interventionist policy to incubate an infant, green industry must address these problems, and, as much as possible, leave the picking of winners to markets. 
In other words: we need a central planner who doesn’t get her hands dirty in the minutiae of short-term fads and rent-seeking firms, but a planner that ensures that every promising solution to our global-warming predicament gets its chance to prove its merits on the marketplace.

Think subsidized [venture capital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital), think research grants, think [business incubators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_incubator), think model cities, think large-scale trials, think phasing-out subsidies.

Don’t think [hydrogen car](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle), [cash-for-clunkers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_Allowance_Rebate_System) or federally subsidized [bioethanol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel).

We don’t need a state to pick the winner. We just need the state to make sure that whoever deserves, enters the competition.
