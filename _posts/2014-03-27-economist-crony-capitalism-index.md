The Economist on its crony capitalism index:

> Inventing a better widget, tastier snack or snazzier computer program is one thing.
> But many of today’s tycoons are accused of making fortunes by “rent-seeking”:
> grabbing a bigger slice of the pie rather than making the pie bigger.
> In technical terms, an economic rent is the difference between what people are paid and what they would have to be paid for their labour, capital, land (or any other inputs into production) to remain in their current use.
> In a world of perfect competition, rent would not exist.
> Common examples of rent-seeking (which may or may not be illegal) include forming cartels and lobbying for rules that benefit a firm at the expense of competitors and customers.

*This* is important.
Fighting cronyism is about equity *and* efficiency -- something that both libera/tarians and social democrats ought to agree on.
Sadly, both sometimes abandon the cause -- liberals/tarians wring their hands when robust state intervention might be called for (telecoms?) and social democrats cozy up to cronies, whenever someone so much as mentions "jobs" (coal?).
Of course, in Germany, France (which is doing relatively ok on the economists index), we also have "corporatism" (health care? third sector?), "coordinated capitalism" (Deutschland AG?) and "industrial policy" ([picking winners in renewables](/2010/01/05/infant-industry-protection-for-low-carbon-tech/)?) to lend respectability to all sorts of rackets to defraud the public.
