Today was the last day of [Bremen International Model United Nations](http://www.brimun.org) (BRIMUN) conference, a simulation of international affairs for students, hosted by Jacobs’ own Model United Nations society. 
I had the pleasure to chair the North Atlantic Council, together with my colleague and friend Matthias. After five days of intense debating, international diplomacy, military confrontations and resolution drafting, the conference has today culminated in its closing ceremony, held in Bremen’s state parliament, the Bremische Bürgerschaft.

Matthias and me much enjoyed working with the 12 dedicated, competent and, well, probably most pacifistic delegates that a military alliance has ever seen. 

BRIMUN’s own crisis team orchestrated a large-scale geopolitical crisis, involving armed attacks on NATO territory as provisioned under Article 6 of the [North Atlantic Treaty](http://www.nato.int/docu/basictxt/treaty.htm), further provoking the alliance by a military coup in Europe’s back yard, threatening to blockade Russian oil pipelines – but NATO delegates, while “gravely concerned” by the unfolding events, persistently refuse to invoke a state of collective self defence as mandated under Article 5 of the [North Atlantic Treaty](http://www.nato.int/docu/basictxt/treaty.htm). 
Much in the spirit of Model United Nations our delegates are deeply devoted to diplomacy and the peaceful resolution of conflicts. 
Eventually, with a little help from “crisis” and Luttwak’s (1999) outrageously provocative essay “[Give War a Chance](http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19990701faessay990/edward-n-luttwak/give-war-a-chance.html)”, Matthias and me got our peace-loving ambassadors where we wanted them … .

> ## NATO – A pacifistic alliance?    
> 
> These days at BRIMUN 2007, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had indeed redefining itself. 
> BRIMUN ambassadors have made every effort to give new purpose to the alliance, which has now for almost 2 decades lost its raison d’être, a perceived hostile Eastern bloc. 
> But … wait a second – isn’t there this new rogue state, the Democratic Federation of the Socialist States of Belarus and the Ukraine that has just toppled the old Ukrainian government and has brutally crushed demonstrations, shooting two American fighter planes over NATO territory in the process? 
> These “incidents” notwithstanding, NATO appears to have learned its lesson from the Cold War: still, provocation must not stand. 
> In 21st century security policy it will simply be ignored. 
> So cold-blooded and devoted to international peace NATO ambassadors are that really, the council has given BRIMUN’s own Crisis Team a hard time. 
> A military cargo airplane, having on board American ambassadorial staff is forced down over the Ukraine – NATO is “deeply concerned by its disappearance” (Resolution 02-04-2007-001). 
> Ukrainian MIGs fire their air-to-air payload over Polish territory – the mightiest military alliance in the world “strongly condemns” it (ibid.). 
> But, luckily for the more bellicose amongst us, the Crisis Department was determined not to let this laisséz-faire stand. 
> When the factual basis of the air attack was questioned, Crisis gave “us” maps, placing the shot-down F16 wreckages well into Polish territory. 
> When the North Atlantic Council, dumbfounded by this conspicuous occurrence pondered how to best reanimate its “Partnership for Peace” program with the (disappeared) Ukraine, Crisis orchestrated a large-scale deployment of Belorussian forces to NATO’s back yard and issued a plethora of highly alarming intelligence. 
> Some two-and-half days into the conference, the Chairs of the North Atlantic Council were finally glad to report to Crisis: “Mission Accomplished” – our most distinguished (and most mollycoddled) ambassadors had finally entered Article 5, stipulating the invocation of the case of collective self-defense, the very essence of the alliance’s pledge for military allegiance. 
> But be assured, delegates will not come to rest now. 
> Crisis in coordination with the Chairs of the Security Council and NATO will continue to make every effort to – if necessary – forcefully plunge our philanthropic ambassadors into the hostile, unforgiving and irreconcilable fiction of our geopolitical crisis – realist style.
> 
> Quite obviously, the philosophy of many of our delegates is “Make love not war”. 
> It shall be noted, that when it comes to the former, some of the honorable ambassadors to the North Atlantic Council are rumored to pursue their goals much more aggressively.

Sure enough, BRIMUN 2007 was another blast: 
we got interesting and competent debates, a geo-political crisis of epic scale and, not to be forgotten, equally epic parties. 
We are greatly indebted to the team behind BRIMUN 2007’s Secretary General Sarah Perumalla and Director General Anna R. Sukkau – and particularly to Fabian Wigands’ crisis team, without which the whole thing would not have been half the fun.

Nonetheless, it strikes me that today is not only the last day of BRIMUN 2007, a great memory and event for my last semester at Jacobs, but also the last day of my (very limited) Model United Nations career. 
It seems to me that the academic and professional merits of these events will always be fairly limited, constrained by a heterogeneous group of participants and diverted by the temptations of Rules of Procedure-battles. 
Granted, I will miss the show and the props. 

Also, whether I will ever see parties as good as those at BRIMUN, I am not sure. 
Without the suits and high heels, the Beck’s beer sponsoring and a crazy team, it might just not be quite the same.

Thanks to everyone and have a great BRIMUN 2008!
