Tonight, it is: our last night in “the bubble”.

After months of preparation, budgeting and attracting sponsors the Graduation Committee, on which I served with a bunch of dedicated colleagues, is ready to pull off a farewell blast tonight, intended to fade all of the other great events and parties we have had over the years.

<!--more-->

Modeled after last year’s “Garden Gala”, the graduation ball of the class of 2006, and the first such event on campus, the venue of our ball will be our campus’ own [International Conference Center](http://www.jacobs-university.de/services/conference/), the (mostly) concrete halls in which we have spent much of the our time here.
Of course, it will look just a little bit different… .

While the preparations were tedious on many days, especially when we were all busy with our studies and final theses, we think we have put together a nice event and look forward to spending this special evenings with our teachers, Jacobs’ staff, our loved ones and all our guests.

See you all tonight!
