[Rabbi David Hartman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hartman_(rabbi)) on power:

> I remember the Quakers coming to see me.
> They wanted to know about my views of power, you know, Quakers.
> So I said, if you have power, you can have a moral argument. If you're powerless, there's no moral argument.
> So if we want to engage the Palestinians in a moral argument of how to live together, then we can only negotiate if we're strong.
> So I have no difficulty even though I'm not a militant person.
> I have no difficulty of Israel being strong because I feel strength invites discussion; weakness invites manipulation.

I hadn't thought of it like that.
It makes sense, though.

I wonder, though, how this compares to what [Haruki Murakami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami) [said](http://www.haaretz.com/culture/arts-leisure/always-on-the-side-of-the-egg-1.270371):

> "Between a high, solid wall and an egg that breaks against it, I will always stand on the side of the egg."
> Yes, no matter how right the wall may be and how wrong the egg, I will stand with the egg.
> Someone else will have to decide what is right and what is wrong; perhaps time or history will decide.
> If there were a novelist who, for whatever reason, wrote works standing with the wall, of what value would such works be?

And then Rabbi Hartman on atheism:

> I think within the concrete.
> I remember my students saying to me, "Rabbi Hartman, I want you to know, but don't get upset with me.
> I became an atheist."
> I said, "When did you become an atheist?"
> He said, "Wednesday." "Oh, boy, that's a remarkable thing. What were you Tuesday?
> You were a believer, right?
> And what happened on Thursday?"
> I said, "Is there any difference between the way you lived when you were a believer and when you became an atheist?"
> And that's the criterion for me.

American Pragmatism, indeed.
