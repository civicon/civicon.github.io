Have you met the perfect tax?

The duty that is both elegant, and fair. 
The regime that lets our economies grow, and have everyone partake in its fruits. 
The excise that reconciles efficiency with equity. 
The set of rules that raises the revenue for a potent polity, and, at the same time, curbs wasteful decadence, to form that [more perfect union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble_to_the_United_States_Constitution).

If you haven’t met the perfect tax, let me introduce you: 
the postpaid progressive consumption tax.

The secret of the perfect tax? 
It burdens that behavior which is truly wasteful and undesirable: 
excessive consumption. 
It leaves all other economic activities unaffected.

Together with a [negative income-tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax) for poor income earners and, possibly, a [wealth tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax) to avoid boundless capital accumulation, it can replace all other [redistributive](http://maxheld.de/2009/10/07/for-redistribution/) taxes, both on individuals and corporations. 


## Big Spenders, Beware: It's Spend, then Tax

So, here it is, an innovative suggestion on how to reform  and [restore](http://maxheld.de/2009/10/07/for-redistribution/) our public finances, in a fair and efficient way. 
It is also the topic of my MPP thesis here at [Hertie](http://www.hertie-school.org).

A progressive consumption tax (PCT) acts, in effect, as if we were to finally slap those luxury taxes on those [Burberry](http://us.burberry.com/home/index.jsp) children coats (starting $340), Louis Vitton bags or Maybach cars. 
Except a PCT does it much more elegantly, and without undue [market distortions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_distortion).

So how does it work? 
You calculate the net worth of a person at the beginning of the year, add all incomes and subtract all losses (from investment, for example). 
That sum, minus the savings at the end of the year, is what that person consumed. 
That amount of consumption is then taxed progressively, and after the fact.

Let’s enlist [Aesop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop)‘s fabled [Ant and Grasshopper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ant_and_the_Grasshopper) to explain an example. 
(The analogy, which I take from [McCaffery](http://edmccaffery.com/) 2005 [^1], is somewhat amiss, for the original Grasshopper does not earn much, but sings.)

Grasshopper earns EUR 30,000 each year, of which he spends everything. He had no savings at the beginning of the year, and none at the end, when winter, or rather, the taxman comes. 
With no savings, all of his income is taxable at a progressive rate, of, say, 10%. 
Grasshopper owes EUR 3,000 to the state.

Thrifty Ant, who also earns EUR 30,000 per year, saves EUR 10,000. 
She also owns a house worth EUR 5,000. 
Her taxable consumption is EUR 20,000 at, for example, 5%, owing EUR 1,000 to the taxman. 
Ant will, of course at some point in the future consume what she has saved, but possibly spread more evenly (thereby avoiding sharply progressive rates) and while earning an interest on her savings (which is *not* income taxed).

Comparing the Ant to the Grasshopper, both of which earn equal incomes, is instructive, but captures only part of the genius that the PCT is: 
it encourages saving, and never punishes income from productive activities, be it in the form of hard work or risky investment. 
Contrast to this progressive income taxes, which tax labor once, and capital even twice (once it is initially earned, and again when it yields a return).


## From Each According to Ability

But there is more. 
Let’s introduce a third beast, the Lion, who powerful as he is, earns a great income of EUR 600,000. 
He also consumes a lot (he is a predator, after all), say EUR 300,000. 
He has accumulated savings of EUR 900,000 to which this year, he adds EUR 300,000. 
Come winter, the (brave) taxman will collect a 33% due on consumption, that is, EUR 100,000. 
Note, that although Lion consumes relatively less (50%) than Grasshopper (100%), he has to pay *relatively* more taxes (33% as compared to 10%), because, in absolute terms, he is encouraged to spend less and save more, given his income-generating abilities.

## It's Not All Pleasure-Delaying

So far, the PCT appears to encourage thriftiness over all else. 
As Ant -- and even the most die-hard supply-side economists -- will attest, *that* alone would make for a fairly sad state of affairs, with all saving, and always delayed consumption. 
As Ant learns, the heart wants some music, too.

Correctly understood, the PCT is actually agnostic towards how much we, as a society, consume or save.

What’s missing in the description so far -- as it is in much of the politics of tax -- is what happens with the revenue. 
Taxation does not reduce resources, but merely redirects them. 
It is then up to the democratic state, or the individuals to which it redistributes, to decide how much should be saved or invested (and there are good reasons to do more of that) and how much should be devoted to consumption.


## S-Classes to Schools

When implemented with an appropriate transition, the PCT *does* not lead to a drop in demand. 
It merely redirects some of those (otherwise conspicuous) [consumption checks](http://maxheld.de/2009/10/07/for-redistribution/) to other, more broadly beneficial, uses. 
The PCT does not change *how much* we consume, but *what*. 
It discourages [excessive consumption for positional gain](http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=postconsumer_prosperity) with individually concentrated benefits, and favors the provision of goods to a greater number of persons.

> Does it really matter how extravagant your wedding gown (or SUV, for that matter) is in absolute terms, or how it compares relatively to the [Joneses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses)?


## Incentives Remain

Some will fear that the PCT may reduce incentives to work hard, and invest wisely, because the ultimate reward of consumption is discouraged. 
Even accepting the (normatively troublesome, and empirically doubtful) premise of incentive-led, fully rational and egoistic human actors, it seems unlikely that the PCT would do anything to demotivate people to work hard. 
It does not abolish individual material rewards, the PCT just *compresses* the range of likely rewards.

Ever since [Thorstein Veblen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen) we have reason to believe that the main motivation of excessive [consumption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption) stems from the attaining or maintaining of social status [^2]. 
Appropriate rewards then need to be only *relatively* higher, but need not be infinitely excessive in absolute terms.

In other words, whether you compete for Volkswagens, or Porsches shouldn’t matter for how hard you work, as long as the [Joneses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses) won’t get that Porsche either.


## A Lot of Pros, And No Cons

- No more need for corporate taxes (which were necessary to prevent progressive income tax evasion).
- Does not reduce incentives to work, or invest.
- Efficiently taxes, but does not authoritatively or arbitrarily forbid extravagant consumption.
- No harder to administer than progressive income tax.
- Curbs collectively wasteful activities.
- Does not distort prices, except in the way it wants to.


## Read. Willing? Able.

The progressive consumption tax will not resolve all public policy problems. 
But it appears to be a promising centerpiece for fiscal reform and rebuilding. 
It is a starting point for the long-overdue overhaul of redistribution, public revenue generation and social policy, with wide-reaching implications.

The progressive consumption tax is a disruptive innovation of "the analytic muddle" that tax is (McCaffery 2005: 921).

It begs many questions: 
How will it affect the wider economy and society? 
How can it be administered efficiently? 
How, and where, can the line between investment and pleasure, be drawn? 
How to treat inter-generational transfers? 
How to achieve the necessary international cooperation? 
How to transition to a PCT-regime?

Analytically, the progressive consumption tax serves as a [normative counterfactual](http://maxheld.de/2009/10/13/setting_goalposts/), asking why we are failing to achieve the equity and efficiency in our political economy it promises.

Politically, the progressive consumption tax is an unforgiving reminder, showing that, indeed, [another world is *possible*](http://www.attac.org/).
More specifically and more helpfully, it shows *just how another brand* of economic liberalization, with sustained progress for everyone, is *doable*.
