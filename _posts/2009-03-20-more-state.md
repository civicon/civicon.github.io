How to alleviate the effects of the financial crisis? 
And how to prevent it in the future? 

These questions are frequently debated and today were the subject of a high profile panel discussion on "[The State and the Financial Crisis](http://www.hertie-school.org/content.php?nav_id=2201)", hosted at the Hertie School of Governnment, Berlin. 
Prof. Dr. Axel Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank and member of the Governing Board of the European Central Bank started the event with a keynote looking into the dynamics, causes and future remedies of the financial and economic crisis. 
A high-ranking panel of experts from government, business and academia then discussed implications and solutions.

After a thoughtful debate on regulatory reform, I cannot help but wonder: 
Is that enough state for a discussion themed "The State and the Financial Crisis"?


## The State as Improved Regulator

(read below for a summary of the event, or skip to the next section).

Much of the talk centered around both short- and medium-term regulatory responses to the financial crises as well as suggestions for future role and business models of banks.

For the short term, Prof. Dr. Weber stressed the importance for central banks to continue to aggressively provide short- and medium-term liquidity, to revive the interbank market and to ease lending and investment by expanding monetary supply. 
On the example of the failed Lehman Brothers he also spoke in favor of bail-outs for financial institutions deemed "too big to fail".

In the medium term, Prof. Weber (and other discussants) urged managers and policy makers to re-establish the "link of responsibility" on loans, even when those are securitized, swapped, repackaged and traded under "originate to distribute" business models. 
Dr. Michael Endres, former CEO of Deutsche Bank, praised the European tradition of debt rather than equity financed small- and medium-sized business and suggested commercial banks should return to their roles as partners of entrepreneurs and firms.

While not everyone thought this was a likely, or maybe desirable scenario, the consensus was that in any case, banks would have to deleverage (rid their balance sheets of some borrowed funds and financial instruments) both to reduce present risk exposure and prevent future crises. 
Also, it was widely expected that financial markets of the future would be simpler and smaller (as a percent of GDP).

To improve the oversight of banks, panelists spoke in favor of routinely including liquidity risks in supervision, which were neglected during the build-up of the crisis. 
The experts also advocated the consideration of extra-balance sheet [special purpose vehicles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_purpose_entity) for capital requirements, as already provisioned under the [Basel II accord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_II). 
Lastly, on the micro-level, the need to improve credit ratings and to preserve the independence of rating agencies was recognized.

On the macro level, Prof. Weber said Deutsche Bundesbank was already looking at systemic risks building in the market, and had done so before the crisis. 
He claimed that, in order to act on this information, the organizations charged with financial market supervision needed (unspecified) "instruments" yet to be legislated. 
State Secretary Jörg Asmussen (Federal Ministry of Finance) pointed to necessary and successful international cooperation in the field of systemic risk oversight and identified lack of trust and coordination as potential problems in the multilateral supervision of financial institutions.


## The State -- "An Instrument of Good" Beyond Regulation?

Upon taking the podium, Prof. Weber likened the current challenges of policy makers and regulators to jogging. 
Especially when running uphill, he said, we like to focus only on the next few meters in front of us, so as not to be discouraged by the daunting climb that ultimately lies ahead. 
Managing the credit crunch, the central banker suggested, was similar: 
faced with an overwhelming crisis, we run the risk of loosing out of sight the medium term goals of regulatory reform in the short term struggle to provide liquidity and stimulus to shrinking economies.

I thought the analogy was powerful, but wondered whether really, we had yet lifted our heads high enough from the fierce economic imperatives of now to dare a look at the broader implications of the crisis, or maybe, the bigger questions it poses.

Mr Asmussen, towards the end of the discussion, posed a dilemma, which indeed begged some as of yet unanswered questions. 
He eloquently described what he called a "time inconsistency" problem of the short and medium term responses: 
For example, we want banks to deleverage, but cannot afford it right away, as it would worsen the credit crunch. 
We need American consumers to save more, and spend less, but further losses in consumer demand threaten to worsen the recession. 
Also, we have long identified the importance of balanced budgets, especially with aging populations in much of the industrialized world, but, for the moment, heavily rely on [deficit spending](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficit_spending) to boost the economy.

I asked the panel whether from this dilemma, and the crisis in general could not arise the instrumental chance and moral obligation to consider a broad, internationally coordinated agenda of redistribution and increasing public spending ratios to boost production as well as to remedy the crisis’ excessive inequities.

Mr Asmussen responded that increasing the public spending ratio would be "overshooting" and threaten a sound balancing of market and state. 
[Prof. Dr. Beatrice Weder di Mauro](http://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrice_Weder_di_Mauro), member of the [German Council of Economic Experts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Council_of_Economic_Experts), added that increasing budget deficits would be no solution.

Regrettably, I find that Mr Asmussen’s dilemma and my question remain unanswered, even unaddressed both in instrumental-rational and moral terms. 

Instrumentally, the question stands whether, when investors hoard capital, markets freeze up and economies slide into sub-equilibrium production, a redistributing and spending state would not be welfare-enhancing. 
Stimulus spending, these days, is largely *consumption* stimulus and exclusively *deficit* spending. 
This, I would argue, is *one* specific and dysfunctional way to increase the public spending ratio. 
What about a state then, who stimulates exclusively *investment* and spends *raised wealth taxes* on *assets* (not capital incomes) ? 

State financed or incentivized investment, to be sure, has to be -- and *can* -- be market efficient, when sound government procurement is the rule and incentives are well-designed. 
The state and the market, are not always diametrically opposed options of how to allocate scarce resources: 
just like private capital, the state can use the market, too. 
Specifically, the state could pump resources into public goods, which free markets typically leave underprovisioned or incentivize long-term investments in innovations, where capitalists’ time horizon may otherwise be too short. 
For example, we could finally move towards making education the *silver bullet* to almost all our problems, we could massively expand public transportation to become more sustainable and mobile or we could further help to hasten the advent and spread of green technologies.

Some of this, to some extent, is already part of present stimulus packages in Europe and the US. 
But so far, all of this is deficit financed, worsening Mr Asmussen’s dilemma and limiting the possibilities for generations to come. 
Seeing that privately owned capital, at least these months, does not seek its most efficient use, why do we not tax some of these assets (not their incomes), and let the state put these resources to productive use? 
Why not use the momentum of this crisis to address the quintessential economic [cooperation problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) of globalization and agree to multilaterally tax internationally mobile private capital?

This points to the intrinsic, maybe even moral value of increasing public spending ratios in this crisis. 
Evidently, the excesses, slumps and bailouts redistributed resources in our societies, and between them, although the direction and magnitude of redistribution is less clear. 
One of the loosers will surely be the taxpayer. 
Who gains? 
Lavish consumers in the US? 
Investors? 
Building industry and consumer good producers? 
None of the above?

No matter in which direction, redistribution happened, and in the form of [bad banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_bank), [moral hazard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard) or illiquidity defaults, it is going to be with us for some time. 
When the market redistributes, at least the question arises whether the state should counteract to re-establish equity, a question which remained conspicuously absent from "The State and the Financial Crisis". 
Also the widespread and justified anger about incompetent managers and reckless investors begs the question whether the state should respond.

"The State and the Financial Crisis" provided a thoughtful and inspiring debate on the regulatory implications of the crises and left no doubt about the competence, well-meaning and determination of the discussants to manage this crisis and prevent future ones from happening. 

But the state they talked about, was a merely regulatory state. 
Redistribution and intervention remained the unaddressed [elephants in the room](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room). 
A little bit disappointed by this minimalist portrayal of the state I was reminded (yet again) of different sentiment I recently heard on the [West Wing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing_(TV_series). 
A sentiment, by which the state is "an instrument of good", where "people come together", and, I would add, not just a watchman for the market.

## Not Enough Questions Asked

The answers to the financial crisis, are more difficult than this fictional sentiment. 
And the discussants at today’s "The State and the Financial Crisis" made every effort not to make answers any simpler than reality permits. 
For this, I am grateful to the panelists and Hertie’s  organizers.

Also, I do not mean to imply that "more state", let alone the shorthand way argued for it here, would provide an easy, if any, answer to the crisis. 
The state has a particularly lousy track record of efficient incentivizing and procurement, the democratic process is easily plagued by earmark projects and excessive public spending can be a drug very hard to wean us from, when we no longer require it.

Notwithstanding these well-founded reservations towards "more state" I have an uneasy feeling that the experts present today, the questions posed in the discussion and the solutions presented are, by and large, from the regulatory-only, maybe even neoliberal camp.

It *is* possible that *these* answers are in fact the only feasible ones. 

But to pose and explore the broader questions and invite more critical panelists surely would have added to the event, possibly including some of those who [protested against the event](http://pressemitteilungen.epo.de/?p=1625) in front of the school. 
Intellectual insulation seldom has any utility. 
At the very least, challengers of regulation-only would have allowed me and my fellow students of public policy to appraise their arguments and to learn, maybe, how *their* answers were simple and flawed.
