These are some early sketches for a possible workshop at [BIGSSS](http://www.bigsss-bremen.de).
{: .notice}

Over the past few years of working on my PhD, I've spent a fair amount of time figuring out the best possible tech-setup.
Ok, to be honest, I procrastinated.
But: While I am still not a programmer (sadly), I've come to the conclusion that hackers have developed a set of great tools, technology and practices that are applicable to social scientists and other knowledge workers, too.

I thought I'd offer a workshop for whomever is interested in this.

<!--more-->

Overall themes would be:
1. [(Free and) open source software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) enables [open science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).
2. Learning efficiency and self-sufficiency in academic writing
3. future-proofing your own work and data by relying on text files (not proprietary or binary formats).

We might cover the following tools and programs:
1. Markdown: A quick and easy markup language for simple notes
2. LaTeX: Professional academic typesetting
3. Git(hub): Version control, or specifically, a distributed source control system
4. Great editors, including Sublime and Atom.
5. BibDesk, an open source bibliography management tool.
