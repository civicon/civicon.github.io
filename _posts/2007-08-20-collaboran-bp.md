After two months of intensive research, brainstorming and planning, the conceptual groundwork for our business is now completed:
Collaboran Systems GbR has today seeded its 80-pages business plan and initial user interface mockup to select partners and investors.

The work of the past two months certainly was one of the most intellectually stimulating and demanding experiences I have ever had.
Innovating and thinking through our business model, considering aspects as diverse as the future of advertisement, issues of human-computer interaction and semi-philosophical arguments around the organization of information and knowledge have made this entrepreneurial experiment a personal success, already now.
For fruitful and challenging discussions I am grateful to my colleagues and friends at [Collaboran](http://www.collaboran.de).

But this project is more than just an intellectual enrichment of the entrepreneurial kind.
The longer we thought and wrote about our product, further detailing its features and business model, we became increasingly confident that we really have innovated how people can collaborate and organize their information.

If you would like to learn more about our product and business model, you are invited to browse our webpages at www.collaboran.de or contact us for access to the business idea presentation and business plan.
