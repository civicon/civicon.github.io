The Economist obituary on Mike Parker:

> Of the more than 1,000 types he developed, his greatest success was Helvetica. It was he who adjusted it, or corralled it, to the needs of the obdurate, cranky, noisy Linotype machines which then printed almost everything in America.
> Originally it was the brainchild of a Swiss designer, Max Miedinger, who devised it in 1956.
> In contrast to the delicate exuberance of 16th-century types, Helvetica was plain, rigidly horizontal—and eminently readable.
> It became, in Mr Parker’s hands, the public typeface of the modern world: of the New York subway, of federal income-tax forms, of the logos of McDonald’s, Microsoft, Apple, Lufthansa and countless others.
> It was also, for its clarity, the default type on Macs, and so leapt smoothly into the desktop age.

Or maybe, another life goal might be to learn about the amazing lives and great works of the people who are obituarized in (e.g.) The Economist.
