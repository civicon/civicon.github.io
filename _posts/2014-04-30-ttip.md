Planet Money has this slightly naive, but not entirely one-sided piece on TTIP and nontarrif trade barriers:

> Today on the show: why can't you build a car that can be driven anywhere in the world?

There might be a lot to dislike about how [TTIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Trade_and_Investment_Partnership) is negotiated (closed-doors, special interest, anyone?)
Still, I don't get the fundamental outrage against Investor State Dispute Settlements (ISDS).
This, as in car safety regulation, is always the logic of economic integration, and it's beautiful thing: trade makes us all richer, but sovereignty moves to a higher, international level.

I can find nothing wrong with "investor protection", per se.
It's also called "rule of law", domestically.

The question is, however, how we can make these ISDS dispute settlements (democratically) *legitimate*.
