Tonight, it was again time for my favorite class at UCI, the “Sociology of Sexuality”, a lower-division undergraduate class, I have decided to audit.

Instructor [Dr. Kassia R. Wosick-Correa](http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~sgsa/2000/2000-kassia.html) has made this course with the ambiguous course code a bit of a legend on campus.
An really, she is an amazing entertainer – and teacher.
Situating the class somewhere between an academic discussion of the topic and advanced sex education, I have the feeling that she is meeting a real need of students.
Even in a 400-person lecture hall, she creates an atmosphere in which students feel comfortable to ask questions and discuss very intimate matters – and they do participate.

I am impressed by the fundamental openness and non-judgmental attitude with which she addresses even the most intricate of topics while at the same time challenging her students.

In short, this is a great class – and show, it just makes people laugh, feel good – and think.
And me, too, I look forward to a three hours of "sexy six"-questions, [porn star panelists](http://laist.com/2007/11/13/sociology_of_sexuality.php), and open-minded, but never indifferent positions and discussions, every Thursday night.
