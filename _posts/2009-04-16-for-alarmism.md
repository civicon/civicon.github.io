I was recently tasked to prepare a presentation on the political economy questions of climate change: 
How expensive is saving the climate? 
And who should shoulder the costs?

As I prepared the presentation for [Dr. Mildner](http://www.swp-berlin.org/forscher/forscherprofil.php?id=6148&PHPSESSID=f0f74)’s "States & Markets" seminar, it occurred to me that to answer these questions, we first have to understand the risks and uncertainties of climate change. 
The real questions, I thought were then different ones:
- How do we manage risk, and respond to uncertainty?
- How do we treat extreme low probability and high consequence events?
- How do we respond to asymmetric risks?

The more I learned about current risk [modeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_assessment_modelling) of the [climatic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Modeling_Forum) and [economic impacts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern_Review) of global warming, the more worried I became [^15]. 
I realized, that climate change (as, incidentally, lessons learned from the financial crisis), requires us to rethink how we manage systemic, interdependent, asymmetric and extreme risks as well as uncertainty.

I agree, we need to act now, and we need to ask strongly.

Yes, this video simplifies. 
Yes, it dramatizes. 
And yes, it scares us.

And it should. 
For when everything is at stake, alarmism is not irrational, it becomes a moral imperative and different risk management is necessary.


## The Costs of Inaction, as we Know Them

The rigor, fervor and tenacity of those economists and climatologists involved in modeling the effects of increased greenhouse gas emissions should put to shame the recently en vogue naysayers of modernity. 
The researchers on the [IPCCC](http://www.ipcc.ch/) and economic analysts of the [Stern Review](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/sternreview_index.htm) do not resign in the face of an alleged "multiplying of" and "undermined rationality" (Beck 2003: 13, 8 [^1]). 
Quite the opposite, their work has, now for some time, put the "unintended consequence" (ibid.:8) of man-made global warming beyond dispute, and what is more, they enable us to act, as we always should, based upon an enlightened understanding of the world we live in. 
Quite essentially modern, in fact.

Sure enough, gauging the effects of increased [greenhouse gases (GHGs)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas) is far from easy. 
Warming, for once, is determined not by the flow of [carbon-dioxide equivalents (CO2e)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_equivalent), but by the stock of GHGs in the planet’s atmosphere, where, once emitted they remain for decades before re-absorption. 
In other words, the only one thing we can influence, present and future emissions, is merely the first derivative, or the slope of global warming. 
What sets in, once greater GHG concentrations increase infrared re-emission, is a chain of yet incompletely understood, dynamic, interdependent, non-linear, non-monotone, discrete, feedback-ridden and possibly irreversible effects. 
The end results of this, as we understand them today, include droughts and floods, rising sea levels, loss of biodiversity and more frequent extreme weather events.

> This figure shows potential changes based on current scientific literature." (Stern 2006:3)

The Stern review then estimates what the likely effects of these climate changes are on human life and economic activity, highly complex systems themselves. 
Material costs incurred, and modeled in the Stern review stem from replacement of capital, transactions in relocation, retraining and disruption as well as from increased uncertainty in planning, investment and insurance. 
In simple terms, some of our material prosperity will be destroyed, some will have to be adjusted, and new ones will be harder to achieve. 
To this, Stern adds quantifications of decreased quality of life, human suffering (and casualties) and loss of biodiversity. 
From this results an average loss of 1.5% of annual GDP in 2050, of 5% in 2100 and 14% in 2200. 
Put differently, if we continue business as usual, in 90 years time, the total amount of goods and services produced on Earth will decrease by 5%, a margin that marks the difference between solid growth and recession in normal business-cycles.

## The Risks and Uncertainties of Inaction of Which we do not Know Yet

The Stern Review, and the assumptions on climate change it makes, are based on complex [Integrated Assessment Models (IAM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_assessment_modelling(, stochastic meta-analyses of risk probabilities found in yet other analyses of greenhouse effects. 
Rather than making "best guesses" on how parameters will change, IAMs integrate probability distributions on each of these parameters to estimate probabilities of aggregate effects. 
IAMs, most notably, the Stern Review, have already pointed to much more dramatic implications of CO2e emissions, as compared to simpler, “best guess” models. 
This holds, even when probability distributions are set to the same mode as the previously held “best guesses”, when risks are assumed to cluster around the best guess. 
This kind of modeling has already gotten us a lot closer to an adequate understanding of the risks of man-made global warming, by putting out likely *ranges* of effects for different atmospheric GHG concentrations.

But there is still much that current modeling is unable to tell us, both for lack of theoretical understanding and computing power.

We know that the cause-and-effect relationships are often complex, even though we are only beginning to understand the exactly *how* (Hamid et al. 2007: 128 [^6]). 
This complexity, to the lay observer (not the climatologist!) takes many forms:

- *Non-linear*: 
GHG concentrations, temperature increases, climate change and economic consequences do not interact proportionally. 
For example, if average temperatures rise, [more water vapor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_feedback), another greenhouse gas, may cause temperatures to rise even further.
- *Discrete*: 
Global warming effects may occur in jumps, where a marginal increase in GHG concentrations or average temperatures over certain tipping points has disproportionately dramatic effects. 
For example, if a marginal temperature increase (above freezing point) causes [tundra permafrost soils to thaw and release captured methane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_methane_release), a highly effective GHG, climate change may accelerate further.
- *Non-monotone*: 
Global warming effects may not be uniform over time and regions. 
For example, harvests and temperatures in Central European, moderate zones, may first increase and then fall dramatically, if melting polar ice [disrupts Gulf Stream heat circulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutdown_of_thermohaline_circulation).
- *Feedback-ridden* and *interdependent*: 
Different effects of increased GHG concentrations may reinforce (or counterbalance!) each other. 
For example, increased average water temperature may depress [oceanic CO2 absorption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle).
- *Irreversible*: 
Effects of global warming may, at the very least by the span of human life, be irreversible. 
Some affected constellations, such as the [polar ice caps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_ice_packs), took thousand of years to build up.
- *Unknown*: 
Some of the dynamics of global warming have only recently been understood or even hypothesized, with more and better insights possible in the future.

From a non-scientist, this list is meant to give but an intuitive insight into the dynamic of climate change. 
Renowned climatologist [Stefan Rahmstorf](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/) of the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/infodesk/tipping-points) recently met with us at the [Berlin Studies Centre](http://www.studienkolleg-zu-berlin.de/?q=node/421), and provided a scientifically sound, more extensive and dramatic list of sixteen potential "[tipping points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_point_(climatology)" in climate change [^11], [^12].

> Potential Anthropogenic Tipping Elements in the Earth System

Human (economic) activity features similarly complex interactions, which need to be modeled to understand the impact of climate change. 
They include second-round effects from economic disruption, as well as sectoral spillovers and [geostrategic risks](http://securityandclimate.cna.org/) (CNA Corporation 2007).

To understand how much of the risk associated with climate change we do not even know yet, it is important to realize that many of the dynamics and complexities described here, are not even included in current modeling. 
Of the sixteen tipping-points identified by Rahmstorf et al. (2009), only the tundra thawing and decreased radiation reflection if reduced ice caps are included in the Stern review.

More fundamentally, the risks are calculated and presented as 90% [confidence intervals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval), the limits of which are often forgotten. 
This conventional reporting of probabilities tells us, of course, that there is a 90% chance that, for example, global average temperature at 550 ppm CO2e increase will be between 1.5°C and 4.5°C. 
It does, however, tell us nothing at all about what could happen within the remaining 10% of the cases. 
The recent history of the financial crisis tells us, that those 10% outside the confidence intervals can sometimes include very disruptive "[fat tails](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_tail)". 
A fat tail occurs for instance, when within the 10% outside the 1.5-4.5°C range, there is a substantial probability for an increase far beyond this range, say of 7-8°C. 
The confidence interval, and indeed, many of our conventional statistic (parametric) tools are blind to these data anomalies, to the likelihood and magnitude of possible extreme events. 
They are blind to low probability, but high consequence events, to unlikely, asymmetric risks that are either very positive or very negative, and of course to uncertainties which we have not yet foreseen. 
The reality of complex systems, unfortunately, is not.


## New Risk Management of Low Probability / High Consequence Events: (Postmodern) Portfolio Choice Theory

It strikes me that as we engage in ever more complex and disruptive interactions with our environment, and the systems by which we organize our activities, we need to change how we think about and manage risk. 
In climate change and sophisticated financial markets, the complexity of cause-and-effect relationships, interdependencies and tipping-points trumps the traditional assumption of normally distributed, bell-shaped risk probabilities.

This insight need not leave us with a shoulder-shrugging, apolitical and reactionary acceptance of unavoidable "unintended consequences" (Beck 2003). 
Portfolio Choice Theory, particularly its [post-modern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodern_portfolio_theory) brands (Postmodern Portfolio Theory, PMPT) provides us with the kind of tools we need for our complex world. 
Nicely contrasting with the typically isolated, and “best guess” perspectives of [Cost-Benefit Analyses (CBA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analyses) PMPT allows us to “treat (climate change) abatement and adaptation actions as bulky investments in natural, human-made and social capital, with the goal of maintaining or enhancing the services they provide” (Ruth et al. 2007: 7,) [^14]. 
It moreover can, and needs to include fat-tailed, non-market, assymetric, correlated and interacted, concentrated and dispersed risks.

The innovation of this new perspective can be easily illuminated comparing two hypothetical investments.

For the traditional, CBA perspective, assume a game of roulette, where an can bet on a black wheel pocket (18 out of 37, or 48.6%). 
Risk, here, is defined by the probability of a red or green wheel pocket (51,3%) and the respective payoffs or losses. 
If the wheel is fair, the investor can know the exact probabilities for any given round, and, if he plays very often, can assume that the deviations from given probabilities will be normally (symmetrically) distributed. 
Also, there are no further complexities or dependencies: 
previous rounds, other players in the casino, or in fact anything but the chance of the roulette wheel are of no consequence. 
In this situation, a rational investor will base his decision on the promised payoff or expected loss. 
The player manages his risk well if he invests (bets) at interest rates of greater than 48.6% and divests (does not bet) at rates below that. 
His welfare is maximized.

For the "post-modern" portfolio choice perspective, assume an IT entrepreneur who decides whether to develop a new web-based social network. 
Risk, here, is defined by the probability of a commercial success and the respective payoff or loss. 
Assume further that a success depends on the behavior of competitors (systemic feedback), the continuing success of a webmail service by the same firm (interdependence), that investment needs to be done in full to be effective (no decision at the margin), that unlikely, but possible complete commercial failure will lead to firm bankruptcy (fat tail) and that success is possible only beyond a certain subscription threshold (discrete, tipping-point). 
Clearly, it is very hard for the IT entrepreneur to manage his risk well and to maximize his welfare. 
From a risk management perspective, it would probably make most sense for him not to take the investment decision at all, but to merge with a great number of other firms, and then to invest the capital in various, unrelated industries (complementary investment against interdependencies), including a sufficient number of low-risk/low-yield assets to be able to offset unlikely, but extreme losses elsewhere (against fat tails).


## A Case for Alarmism, Strong and Fast Action

Doing this kind of risk management for climate change will not be easy, and it will not be cheap. 
We have to sustain and increase research efforts to include new and more dynamics into our risk modeling. 
In the meantime, we have to deal with the uncertainty of incomplete risk modeling.

Skeptics will call for moderation in our abatement and adjustment response under uncertainty. 
They may point to the possibility of equally unlikely, extreme positive events (for example, successful [carbon capture and storage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage) technology). 
Or, most troublesome for environmentalists, they convincingly stress the opportunity costs of abatement and adjustment by hypothesizing the likely and extremely positive effects of investment in other areas (for example, education). 
Or, bluntly and irresponsibly, they will negate the risks altogether and exaggerate the costs of abatement. 
An outrageous example for the latter is the following ExxonMobil sponsored TV ad:

<iframe width="960" height="720" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0_VmMIbWKoo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
> Carbondioxide.
> They call it pollution.
> We call it life.
> -- TV ad by the [American Enterprise Institute](http://www.aei.org/)

I believe that all of the skeptics, even the more serious and well-meaning, are mistaken in their treatment of risk and uncertainty.

When probabilities are low or unknown, but respective events are of high, possibly disastrous, irreversible consequence, responsible risk management places extra emphasis on downside risks and on fat tails. 
Even assuming that risks were, in fact completely known, symmetric, and bell-shaped (normal), all of which is likely not the case, we must employ the necessary resources to minimize extreme downside risks.

The Stern Review concludes that fast and strong action is necessary, and economically rational. 
In the face of the remaining, small uncertainty, in fact, even in the absence of the Stern Review’s assessment, comprehensive and expensive adjustment and abatement efforts are required.

The Stern Review, if anything, is conservative and skeptical in its risk management. 
The current state of scientific knowledge, and to no lesser degree, the uncertainties that remain, then makes alarmism not irrational, but morally imperative. 
For, as the lifeguard knows, when everything is at stake, it is better to be safe than sorry.
