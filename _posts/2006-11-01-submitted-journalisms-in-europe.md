Today, Prof. Hartmut Wessler has submitted a paper on “Journalisms in Europe” to the [International Communication Association](http://www.icahdq.org/) for review concerning its 2007 annual conference. 
The paper has been co-authored by me and three other student colleagues. 
The project is based on a quantitative content analysis of news items from online versions of 30 European newspapers, originally conducted in the undergraduate research seminar “[Media Communication in the European Union](http://www.jacobs-university.de/academics/courses/Fall_2005/SHSS/960101_1/)”, held by Prof. Hartmut Wessler at International University Bremen in Fall 2005. 
The paper reviews and integrates initial research findings from the research seminar.

This project represents one of the first systematic comparisons of online newspaper coverage from both old, new and future EU member states. 
Conversely, much of the comparative analyses tries to shed light on the differences and similiarities in journalistic styles as well as levels of Europeanization and studies their respective determinants.

Both inspiring and challenging, working on this project has given me a first insight into how strenuous it can be to integrate a coherent argument, to undergo several reviews and to present statistical findings, all according to academic standards suitable for publication; a learning opportunity for which I am grateful to Prof. Wessler and my colleagues.
