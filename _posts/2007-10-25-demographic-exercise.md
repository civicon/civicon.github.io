I have today completed my first assignment in demographics, a mostly empirical exercise in explaining global patterns of fertility, population growth and life expectancy through levels of socio-economic development, reflecting the theory of demographic transition.
In this specific exercise, I looked at the relationship between population development and the degree of female schooling, urbanization and national income (GNP/capita).
Surprising at first sight, but in line with much prominent research, I found female schooling to be most strongly related to suppressing population growth and increasing life expectancy.

I was also curious to see whether I could find a relationship between population change and value orientations, specifically Inglehart’s and Welzel’s (2005) value dimensions of secular-rationalism and self-expressionism.
While in much of the scholarly debate, value change and modernization theory appear to be opposing rather than complementary concepts, Inglehart and Welzel (2005) have recently suggested a reformulation of modernization theory that integrates both economic and value change, at the macro and micro level.
Based on a massive body of empirical evidence, they argue that the underlying theme of this process (of modernization) is the broadening of human choice (2005: 2).
They present strong cross-national ﬁndings, suggesting two value dimensions as key components of mutually reinforcing and intertwined trajectories of economic, social and political development, with respective micro-level (market orientation, emancipative values, support for democracy) and institutional, macro-level reﬂections (free market economy, liberal pluralistic society, democratic order).
So, I thought, why not test that, too ...
Given the small number of cases for which I had data readily available, the results are less than impressive ... but a trend is definitely discernible.

While this assignment was hardly a full-grown discussion of the topics, nor an in any way original empirical test, it served well "to get our feet wet", as our instructor [Prof. Dr. Susan Brown](http://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=4670), had promised and qualified my interests for further papers.
