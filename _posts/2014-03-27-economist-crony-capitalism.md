Edmund Fawcett in a letter to the Economist:

> Liberalism is a doctrine of limits.
> One of its lessons is that not all political goodies—freedom, equality, prosperity, for example—need be simultaneously achievable.
> In the democratic marketplace, that lesson is a hard sell.
> Ought not The Economist, which is impeccably liberal, be more forthright and tough it out?

Yes, exactly, *this* is the kind of ethical / axiomatic acuity that we need in our polity:
to understand another (in this case, liberal) person's argument *on their own terms*, including their tradeoffs.
[Simon Niemeyer](http://deliberativedemocracy.anu.edu.au/dr-simon-niemeyer) and [John Dryzek](http://socpol.anu.edu.au/people/academic-staff/john-dryzek) might call this _meta consensus_. [^1]
Maybe, hopefully, deliberation (and a thoughtful Economist) can bring us closer to that last end.
