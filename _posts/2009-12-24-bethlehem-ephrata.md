Last Christmas, Pastor Brusermann at a local church near my hometown (Weyhe’s [Felicianius Church](http://www.kirche-weyhe.de/kirchweyhe/)) told the congregation that Christmas also meant that "this world could be made good, again".

The reverends inspirational sermon stuck with me, and the beauty and the power of the nativity story occurred to me, again, and anew.

Christmas is many things to many people, sure. 
To many others, it is nothing.

And still, it seems, if only it brought a little more of that love and kindness at Heathrow’s arrival gate, particularly to those in dire need of it, it’d be worth our while. 
(Nevermind the [excessive consumption](http://www.maxheld.de/2009/10/26/progressive_consumption_tax/)).

And yet, this most beautiful and powerful of stories, the nativity play, can be so much more.

It’s not just a correctness-embellished "Season’s Greeting", not just the consumption stimulus, not just the borderline kitsch of a  "feel good" (rather than do good) romantic comedy.

It’s a stubborn conviction, that against all odds, in the coldest of winters and smallest of stables, "this world could be made good again".

It’s a little hard to believe this Christmas, as always. 
[Copenhagen](http://maxheld.de/2009/12/10/the-copenhagen-game/) has failed to aid the poor, and to save the planet. 
A student, [who wasn’t born wanting to do this, stabbed](http://maxheld.de/2009/03/11/not-born-to-do-this/) his female teacher to death. 
And neither the Palestinian Bayt Lahm (or Beit Lehem) nor Israeli-occupied/settled Efrat heed the call of their ancient son, "and this man shall be peace" (Micah (5:2), King James Version).

And still, this message of salvation, that is given to us, may also be the most precious gift we can give each other if we let it inspire us to believe in real change.


## ... That There Went Out a Decree from Caesar Augustus

It becomes a gift for everyone, when we make it a message of political salvation, too, of how we all live together, not just of personal gratification, at Heathrow, and elsewhere.


## ... and Laid Him in a Manger

And already, it is a political story -- indeed, a scandal. 
That in this  small village "among the thousands of Judah", to the smallest of people, carpenter Joseph and virgin Mary an illegitimate child is born, that shall "reign in peace for ever".

*This* is the kind of good news, that we need. 
This can be *our* message of salvation from the injustice of a people, inequality between people and repression of a young woman. 
For still today -- if no more to carpenter and virgin -- a child is born into this so flagrantly fallible world, under the most dire of circumstances.

Let us let shine that unreasonable hope emerging from the stable, for the life chances of that child, here and now, and not just tonight.

> This child that lies a helpless boy    
> shall yet become your endless joy
> shall frustrate Hell’s endeavour    
> and reign in peace for ever.    
> -- Choral: Brich an Du schönes Morgenlicht, Christmas Oratorio, BWV 248. Johann Sebastian Bach.


## Be Not Afraid!

> Be not afraid! For behold! I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people, for unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour which is Christ the Lord.
> -- Rezitativo: Und der Engel sprach zu Ihnen, Christmas Oratorio, BWV 248. Johann Sebastian Bach.

That Lord is born, and an Angel sends the herdsman to meet him first, and then sings to them, the most beautiful song, not be afraid. 
It is their elevation from the plights of working in the field, and it can be *our* message of salvation how to leave no one behind, and for the wolves, that we are to each other.


## ... And on Earth Peace, Good Will Toward Men ...

With all the decked halls, the presents, the love and the food, let’s not miss the wood for all the Christmas trees: 
today, we celebrate this amazing message of salvation. 
Let’s make it our message of salvation, our stubborn hope and unfailing resource for change. 
Let’s rediscover the message of  political hope, that it also is.

And then, to act on it: 
no matter how improbable the change we need appears, no matter how humble and small a single one contribution can be, and, against all unforgiving ridicule, to always do it in the spirit of love and kindness.

For that would be the greatest present, especially to those who will receive none tonight:
"to make that world good, again", as Pastor Brusermann said last Christmas already.

Or, for now, a lot better,
