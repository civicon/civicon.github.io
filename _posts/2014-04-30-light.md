Planet Money has this great story on the history of (artificial light):

> The history of light explains why the world today is what it is.
> It explains why we aren't all subsistence farmers, and why we can afford to have artists and massage therapists and plumbers.
> (And, yes, people who do radio stories about the history of light.)

This, and Frédéric Bastiat's "[Candlemakers' Petition](http://bastiat.org/en/petition.html)" is for the luddite in all of us.
