It has been shown that beyond institutional and material conditions, mass beliefs can help explain differences in democratic and economic development between human societies (Inglehart & Welzel 2005). 
Human Development, argue Inglehart and Welzel can be understood as a process of emancipation, cherishing ever more choice (ibd.). 
Two dimensions of respective value changes can be identified; one towards secular-rational values, reflecting the transition to modern industrial society, and, one towards self-expression values, typical for postmodern and postindustrial societies (ibd.).

For the class “Statistical Methods II” me and my colleagues Wajeeha Bajwa, Sinziana Chira, Vivian Ebert, Lisa Heindl and Henrik Mädler set out to test the relationship between those value orientations and socio-economic status on the individual level. 
We hypothesized that individuals high on these two dimensions were likely to achieve a higher social status.

Our statistical findings provide strong support for our hypothesis. 
Moreover, we find that the explanatory power of the two value-orientations differs over different countries. 
It appears that in countries that are transitioning to industrial societies, secular-rational values better predictors of individual socio-economic status, whereas in postindustrial societies, self-expression values are more important. 
This suggests that these respective value orientations also allow individuals to best adapt to the corresponding societal settings.
