I just got these messages on my cellphone from [UCI](http://www.uci.edu)'s [text alert system](http://www.nacs.uci.edu/announce/zotalert.html), just like everyone else enrolled at or otherwise affiliated with the university. 

>January 20th 2008, 20:48
>6:30PM ARMED ROBBERY IN 4069 MESA CT 2 MALE ASIAN SUSPECTS 18-20 5’7’’ TO 5’9’’ W/BANDANAS, 1 W/BLK HANDGUN, FLED SCENE W/DUFFLE BAG STAY INSIDE LOCK DOORS

> *zotAlert* Update on armed robbery – no signs of suspects on campus, but appr. safety measures should be taken. If you have any info call UCIPD at 949-824-5223

I am sure this alert system, in principal, has many potential benefits, and I do not mean to negate the violence suffered by the victims of this particular incident and the hypothetical threat it posed to other community members. 
Still, these messages got me thinking whether we are indeed focusing our attention and resources on the right things, when we are letting our fears guide us.
The question is not, as some conservative critics may respond, whether or not the fear of assaults on campus, or other fears –- of terrorism, of child abduction or of sex offenders –- are well-founded. 
These risks, like many others, are not merely constructs, but are real threats, and our fear of them can be very functional to protect us from harm.

> -- [Charlton Heston](http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106348/Charlton-Heston), then president  of the [National Rifles Association (NRA)](http://www.nra.org), arguably the institutional epitome of a culture of fear at the 129th convention at Charlotte, NC, shortly after the [Columbine High School massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre). 

The question is, whether given our limited political attention span and conversely, the limited responsiveness of our political system, as well as our limited material resources, we are getting the most of it, when we let ourselves be guided by what we are afraid of. 
Again, I am not suggesting we should not try to build safe campus communities, be tough on national security or protect our children from abuse. 
These are all important issues, that require careful policy making and the allocation of substantial resources.

As so often in politics, we need to think in terms of opportunity costs. 
What are we getting for the costs incurred by the installation and maintenance of UCI’s text messaging alert system? 
What are the chances that this text message, usually sent with a substantial delay, will really make anyone safer? 
What else could we be doing for the community with that money and attention? 
Maybe *that* would allow us to really make our campuses better, not just *safer* places. 

And what about that [roadside information system](http://www.amberalert.gov/), alerting drivers-by of recently abducted children -- what are the chances this is going to safe a child, compared to the opportunities of putting the millions it costs to set up this infrastructure into our kindergartens, families and schools to make our children strong and into our prisons to allow meaningful reform and rehabilitation?

But criticizing a culture and politics of fear demands more than just submitting our policies to a simple cost/benefit analysis. 
We have to ask ourselves what kind of representation of our social and political world we subscribe to, when we let fear cloud our vision and thinking. 
The politics and culture of fear in our societies are more than just a peculiar misbalance between costs and benefits of associated policies. 
They follow a highly dysfunctional dynamic, one which we need to understand and deconstruct. 
The politics and culture of fear deform our political discourse, provide veritable incentives to actors, who play along and play it well, and are, conversely reinforced and reconstituted by those actors.

Again, and I cannot say this with enough emphasis, I do not at all mean to belittle the suffering of victims of crime. 
But we have to ask ourselves what representation of reality we let, for example, UCI’s text alert system create in our minds. 
I cannot help it, but feel a sense of alertness, threat and, well, fear, when I read about the armed robbery that happened a few hundred feet from my home, just two hours ago. 

But should I really let these feelings determine how I think of my surroundings here at UCI? Clearly, the answer is no. 
Not only does this disconcerting message bear very discomforting dangers of racial stereotyping (as so often, when it comes to feelings of fear), the sense of fear it so easily creates in the recipient’s mind is also a highly distorted presentation of reality. 
UC Irvine, luckily, and surely thanks to a very proactive campus safety regiment, is a very safe campus, and may just be one of the safest areas in one of the safest counties (OC) in all of the United States. 

One the most abhorrent crimes that does plague this community, (attempted) rape, of which, according to some statistics, one in four college women are victims, cannot be prevented by a text alert system. 
"College rape", like so many other acts of crime and violence, happen not out in the open, committed by the proverbial (often racially defined) stranger jumping out from the scrubs. 
Sexual abuse, for the most part, happens between acquaintances, friends or even lovers. 
We can best prevent it by making our communities and students stronger, by fostering mutual caring and respect and by fighting the dysfunctional attitudes to sexuality and the abusive relationships around us. 
[UCI's "One in Four"](http://spirit.dos.uci.edu/oneinfour/) chapter is one such initiative, which is committed to this cause and which I admire very much for the work they are doing.

And yet, just a couple of days ago, I met with one of my students, who told me how she did not feel safe enough anymore to cycle to and from school, but is now taking the car and working out in the gym, as if indeed, as text alert suggests, danger would be a stranger, lurking in the dark. 

We cannot neglect the effects that these ever-present messages of threat will have on our collective representation of reality. 
Whether it is the fivefold threat level indicators of the homeland security  advisory system at the airport, the readily available (and, to my mind, morally and legally very problematic) maps of sex offenders in our neighborhood, the flashing message about an abducted child on our morning commute or the NRA promoting firearm ownership as a civic duty of self-protection, these cues will be consequential for how we view the world we live in and for the political decisions we make.

This distorted, fear-ridden view of reality is of course, chiefly promoted in local cable news, featuring life coverage of police chases, and a selection of only the most bizarre and abhorrent sex and crime "stories" from your local neighborhood and the nation. But even the mainstream, supposedly higher quality media, such as the "first-name-in-news" [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/) is participating in this reality distortion project, such as in its evening newscast "Situation Room", where host [Wolf Blitzer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Blitzer) guides viewers through a kaleidoscope of always current, and often breaking news, accompanied by simultaneous live (?) video feeds on eight flat-panel displays.

What is it, that gets us to buy into this reality warp of ever-present fear in public discourse and policy and, more abstractly, cult of fierce urgency, the "if it bleeds, it leads", the "new and now" mantra of mainstream media? 
For once, we are conditioned to respond to threatening cues, and that, in itself, is a very healthy response. 
It gets problematic only because we are being overloaded with carefully crafted, often visually or narratively dramatized, fundamentally distorted cues. 
And of course, fear, drama and urgency are entertaining; we like and believe it, because "[we’ve seen this movie before](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E6DA163BF935A2575AC0A9679C8B63)" (Gabler 2001). 

This of course, nicely ties in with the arguments of policy makers and activists ("people want to be protected") and media producers ("people want to be entertained") engaged in the politics and culture of fear and urgency. 
We need to move beyond these seemingly hermetic justifications of a deeply dysfunctional system. 

First of all, social and political reality is not a melodrama, happening exclusively (or even majorly) through fundamentally inexplicable "breaking news". 
Politics and history do not spontaneously unfold in CNN’s Situation Room, they are determined, often in the long run, through motivated actions of individuals, shaped and structured through institutions. 
For a functional public discourse, we need our media to render intelligible events and long-term trends as embedded, causal processes, thereby enabling a fundamentally enlightened perspective: 
that the social and political world in which we live is shaped, and thereby can be changed by human will.

Secondly, we have to recognize the politics and culture of fear as what it is; a profoundly impoverished view on social and political progress as the reduction or absence of threats (something that, of course, we never will be able to achieve). 
Social and political agendas in this spirit are thereby negatively defined, in terms *of what we do not want and what we fear* rather then in positive terms of *what we want and wish to be*. 

Thirdly, we have to expose the politics and culture of fear and urgency as an hegemonic construct that serves the material interests of those who wish to maintain the status quo. 

A cult of urgency and breaking news, for once, effectively depresses our ability to think of change as something that we can affect as participants, rather as stories that we can ABC-"[eye-witness](http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/)" unfold as CNN-Situation Room-spectators. 

The culture and politics of fear support the status quo, by promoting a negatively defined view on progress, instituting an essentially neoliberal (in the economic sense), minimalist perspective on the role of the state as limited to providing the institutions for a perfect market (property rights, basic infrastructure) and concentrating on the absence of disruptions and externalities (such as crime). 
In that way, social and political agendas responsive to the culture and politics of fear can effectively suppress more fundamentally progressive perspectives.

To overcome its inertia and impoverishment, we therefore need to complement and challenge the politics and culture of fear and urgency through positively defined agendas, that address the constraints (and, yes, threats) of the real world, but focus on opportunities for empowerment, progress and positive development that lie ahead.

After all, as presidential candidate [Barack Obama](http://www.barackobama.com) recently said,
