> Why do we become so unequal, and why would that be unfair?

> The course introduces participants to social scientific theories, applies them to education and migration and offers observations from a german inner city school.
> We'll discuss how things might be better, and who, how, can bring about such change – to keep our capitalist and liberal societies prosperous, and to make it more just.
