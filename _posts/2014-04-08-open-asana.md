Asana, maker of e-mail free collaboration software and "work graph", on its future:

> Imagine this: the year is 2016. 
> It’s the beginning of the day and you’ve just arrived at work. 
> You sit down at your desk (assuming that having a desk is still a “thing”) and open Asana. 
> What do you see?

I'm the biggest fan of e-mail-free-collaboration; but to be fair, Asana also has an ulterior motive here.
E-Mail is an open standard. Asana, inspite of all the API-magic of the world, is not, meaning a future in which collaboration is free of email, but full of Asana, also means great revenues for Asana Inc. and (potential) lock-in for users.

So here's a radical idea for Futurasana 2016: Why not open source (much of) Asana, so as to *really* make it future-proof and open. Nothing wrong with making a dime, of course -- maybe Asana could go the way of Github.com and make money on the (proprietary) social graph and the convenience of hosting, all the while keeping user data and software open?

Open-sourcing can also, of course, jumpstart developer creativity and help make any one software the de-facto standard (again, think git).

I want to love Asana. Just like in, say, 2002, I loved Outlook. Didn't work out for the both of us, and we had an ugly divorce, with lots of data lost. I don't want to be in that situation again.
