[Peter Sloterdijk](http://www.petersloterdijk.net) has recently called for a [radical rethinking of redistribution](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/957/499238/text/) [^1]. 
He criticized “compulsory taxation” (sic!) as fiscal kleptocracy inadequately degrading its citizens intosubjects of tax laws, rather than encouraging the rich to give. 
He cited US philanthropy and suggested to promote voluntary donations in lieu of taxes, thinking of (rich) people as givers, not as takers.

Sloterdijk’s hyperliberal argument may be spearheading the kind of uncritical naturalizing of private property that also underlies much of the [praise of foundations](http://maxheld.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/sloterdijk/2010/03/27/foundations-may-be-bad/). 
Sloterdijk has it wrong when he believes that [he doesn’t owe the polity much](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/957/499238/text/6/) to be taxed.

We do in fact, owe the polity a lot, and certainly all of our private property. 
This is not to say that property is theft, as the latrine Marxists like to sloganeer. 
This is to say: 
private property is never pre-social, is never independently our own doing. 
To begin with, private property is real only in so far as we mandate and equip a state to uphold it, just like all the other public goods, on which all individual prosperity relies (think: streets, social peace). 
Also, we have plenty of [empirical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure) and normative reasons to believe that market outcomes are at best an imperfect indicator of achievement. 
Lastly, we know that social inequality can be self-reinforcing and we know that wealth has [diminishing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality#Utility.2C_economic_welfare.2C_and_distributive_efficiency), if not [conspicuous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption) returns.

None of this is to say that rich people are bad people, an easy political sell that too many populists go for (this, Sloterdijk is right about). 
This is to say: 
rich people are rich because they earned a lot of the carrots we apparently need to keep things going. 
They deserve to eat and enjoy some of these carrots (consumption), because, ideally, they have created great value for everyone around them. 
Also, it’s probably a good idea to entrust these people with capital, because they ideally know how to make good use of it (investment).

Rich people aren’t rich because they created the carrots or capital out of mid-air. 
The polity handed out these consumption checks, and the polity has every right to bounce some of them, if that is considered fair.

Voluntary donations instead of progressive taxation and eternally tax-exempt foundation endowments restrict the polity’s right to do this rebalancing and reallocating. 
They shouldn’t. 
Private property isn’t theft, but neither is taxation.
