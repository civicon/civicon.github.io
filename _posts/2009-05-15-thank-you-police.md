*Update*: Yesterday (12/06/2010), a group of leftist protesters [attacked police](http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/protestler-verletzten-zwei-polizisten/1857768.html) with an [IED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device) (*not* "just" fireworks, it appears). 
Two injured officers had to undergo surgery.

Here’s my wish to the radical left, and everyone else: 
can we have a demonstration condemning this brutal and senseless violence, please? 
You can count me in. 
I’ve had it with the acquiescence and even jovial affirmation of anti-police violence. 
No one ever is a [pig](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrike_Meinhof#Wandlung_und_Untergrund), and certainly not someone in uniform, doing this very hard and thankless job for all of us.

[Here's](http://maxheld.de/2009/05/15/thank-you-police) why I think we should be thankful to them:

Last night, I witnessed a minor quarreling at a Berlin beach bar. 
As the conflict threatened to turn violent, we called the police, which promptly arrived, and handled the dispute.

As the six officers were handling the situation, us standing by and debating whether the police was doing the right thing, I couldn’t help but wonder whether we were paying the men and women in uniform doing this thankless job the respect and tribute they deserve.

The quarrel between the club’s staff and an apparently homeless man arose over an alleged theft of my friend’s handbag, including a digital camera and purse (all of which were later returned). 
One of the bartenders claimed to have seen the homeless man snatch the bag, and then confronted him outside the club. 
The encounter quickly became agitated, with another, particularly aggressive club employee having what appeared to be a more fundamental axe to grind with the homeless man. 
As the aggressive employee moved from fisticuffs to threatening the homeless man with a broomstick and proceeded to escort him back into the beach club, I decided it was time to call the police.

Berlin Police arrived shortly after, with three squad car crews followed by a team in combat gear. 
I felt pretty bad for having caused the police so much hassle over this relatively minor incident. 
A colleague from the Hertie School of Governance remarked that "there was definitely no shortage of state resources here", as the heavy cavalry set in.

In Germany, we are always wary of repressive and powerful law enforcement, which twice in our history has brought untold sorrow and enabled horrendous crimes to be committed. 
Notwithstanding our justified skepticism, it occurred to me later, the ready availability of this state resource isa  formidable achievement for a society, and one which we too easily neglect or take for granted.

With that, particularly in liberal, leftist and educated circles frequently comes a disregard and mistrust of the men and women in uniform who do this unpleasant job for us.

As the police were trying to untangle the situation and get the pitifully deprived homeless man and the agitated shop-keeper off each other’s chest, I couldn’t help but feel deeply uneasy, eager to leave.

I, and as I imagine, many of the leftist "[Bullenschweine](http://wissen.spiegel.de/wissen/dokument/dokument.html?id=44931157)"-shouters (a derogatory, dehumanizing term for police officers), have never lived through the deprivation, frustration and violence of an average officer’s working day. 
Nor do I, like many of the pampered police-bashers, frequently depend on an officers’ help precisely because I live so well protected and insulated from the more precarious social realities of our societies and cities.

The job we ask these brave men and women to do is poorly paid, often inadequately equipped and sometimes involves danger for life and limb. 
It is also a job of high risk and no reward, one that hardly ever earns our recognition but one on which we dearly rely. 
We have to recognize this unthankful arrangement as what it is: 
a form of [structural violence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_violence) and injustice, terms the left, oddly enough, is otherwise not shy to use.

Police violence is a sad reality, an unacceptable failure of the state and a coward crime. 
But we must also understand, not justify it, in terms of the structural injustice and violence it breeds in. 
Given their frequent exposure to violence and danger, recently including [attempted murder of two officers](http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/1-Mai-Demonstrationen-Kreuzberg;art270,2788620), who were set on fire by Mai 1st rioters, it is hardly surprising, if still unacceptable, that police officers sometimes develop reactive esprit de corps, overstep their powers or even turn violent. 
From Philip Zimbardo’s [Stanford Prison Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment) on, social psychology has taught us about the power of those situations, warned us of blaming individuals and advised us to take organizational precautions.

As much as individual failures and crimes, we must understand these transgressions as products of our societal neglect to adequately equip, pay, train and counsel the people who take on this hard job and unforgiving uniform.  
Rather than demonize and bash the police, we must commit the necessary resources to enable them to do the job as professionally and as carefully as we need them to, all the while remembering that, for the most part, law enforcement is [treating symptoms, not causes](http://maxheld.de/2008/01/21/culture-of-fear/) of societal ill.

In the meantime, all we can do is to unambiguously speak out against ignorant police bashing, condemn violent acts against them, no matter from which political aisle,  and to show our officers the respect and regard they deserve.

Thank you, police.
