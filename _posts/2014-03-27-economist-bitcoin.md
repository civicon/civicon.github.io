Nailed it, The Economist.

Bitcoin bears many exciting opportunities, among them:
- medium of exchange (think: lower transaction costs than Paypal, Visa, MasterCard)

But:
- store of value?
- medium of account?

Not so much.

Maybe, then, bitcoin serves best as stimulus to tinker, to reflect on, and to disrupt current money institutions.

Here's one half-baked thought:
Given that money is *one* institution (or policy) but has to serve these *three* related means, is it maybe a case for the [Tinbergen rule](http://ralphanomics.blogspot.de/2011/02/tinbergen-rule.html)?
Maybe, it's not an accident that bitcoin does so well with one, but not the other two functions of money.
Could they be disentangled?

Also, could there be an objectified, cryptographic process that automatically tied blockchain growth (aka money supply) to economic activity?
If someone could fix that, that'd be nice.
No more monetary "policy".
