Labor is both a central category in modern thought, and in economics.
This course tracks critical formulations, describes the elementary economics of who is earning what, for what work, and questions the human *cooperating* condition.
The class offers a schizodisciplinary synthesis of history of ideas, political economy and social anthropology.
